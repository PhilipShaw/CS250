# CS250

**Below are my responses to three questions from CS 250 regarding the use of agile principles**

Question 1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

It's important to remember that a client's vision will often need some help during the conception process. When helping users
approach this, it may be helpful to focus on the essential objectives that they would like to achieve. This is where user 
stories can be increcibly helpful, as they're intended to atomize a user's requisites as much as possible. User stories do need
to be honed throughout development, as these requirements may change. However, this concept helps to encapsulate users' needs
more concisely overall. In turn, this helps the project to remain focused and avoids the development of features that aren't needed.

Question 2: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Based on case studies from our textbook—The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile—iterative development models tend to be more 
advantageous for developing programs than linear beginning-to-end development. While iterative development predates the "agile" 
methodology, our course focused on agile principles and processes throughout CS 250. Concepts that I've been introduced to—and 
hope to employ again include: 
- Short developemnt loops known as "sprints" 
- Populating product backlogs with user stories
- Client and end-user inclusion throughout each project
- Continuous unit/regression testing to make developent more efficient
- The use of effective information radiators to aid communication

Question 3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
The idea of working with other people to create something useful and groudbreaking can seem exciting. Of course, in practice
this doesn't always go as planned due to unforseen circumstances, deadlines and miscommunication. A good team member recognizes
that these things will occur, and will do their part to mitigate these 
Strong communication, empathy, a willingness to place the project over personal preferences.
