# CS250

**Below are my responses to three prompt questions from CS 250 regarding the use of agile principles**

**Question 1: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
It's important to remember that a client's vision will often need some help during conception. When assisting clients with
clarifying requirements, it may be helpful to focus on the essential objectives that they would like to achieve. This is where user 
stories can be incredibly helpful, as they're intended to atomize a user's requisites as much as possible. While user stories will need
to be honed throughout development, this practice helps to encapsulate users' needs more concisely overall. In turn, this helps the 
project to remain focused and avoids dedicating resources to building features that aren't needed.

**Question 2: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
Based on case studies from our textbook—The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile—iterative development models tend to be more 
advantageous for developing software than linear beginning-to-end development. While iterative development does predate the "agile" 
methodology, our course focused on agile principles and processes throughout CS 250. Concepts that I've been introduced to—and 
hope to employ again—include: 
- Short development loops known as "sprints" 
- Populating product backlogs with user stories
- Client and end-user inclusion throughout each project
- Continuous unit/regression testing to make development more efficient
- The use of effective information radiators to aid communication

**Question 3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
The idea of working with other people to create useful and groundbreaking software can be exciting. Of course, this doesn't always 
go as planned in practice. Unforeseen circumstances, deadlines and miscommunication can take a toll on teams and projects. A good 
team member recognizes this and takes precautions to mitigate miscommunication, provide encouragement for fellow team members, and
ensure that their work on project artifacts and code is comprehensible by other members of the team. Ultimately, a good team member 
remembers that _people_ take precedence over tools and processes.
